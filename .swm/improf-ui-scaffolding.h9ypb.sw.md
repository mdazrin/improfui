### Navigation Bar

```
<nav class="bg-emerald-400 border-b-4">
    <div class="flex justify-between">
        <div>
            <img class="w-32 h-24" src="asset/Improf.png" alt="Improf Logo">
        </div>
        <div class="flex no-wrap">
            <div class="px-1 py-5">
                <button class="rounded-md bg-indigo-500 px-5 py-1 text-white font-semibold shadow-lg transition
                hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-110">
                    Register
                </button>
            </div>
            <div class="px-1 py-5">
                <button class="rounded-md bg-indigo-500 px-5 py-1 text-white font-semibold shadow-lg transition
                hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-110">
                    Sign In
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
```

The code is the snippet of the navigation bar. We set the nav bar colour to emerald, one of IMProf colour palette. The nav bar comes with a border with four widths. Inside, we build a div as a placeholder. The div is in flex property which enables the inside items to shrink or grow based on direction. The items will be in justify-between as the logo image will be placed on the left and the buttons on the right. The items inside the div are:

*   Div Image
    
*   Div Register button
    
*   Div Sign In button
    

The first flex item is image. We create a div for the image. The size is width 32 and height 24. The source is in asset folder.

The second and third items are the buttons. For each button, we create a div and put button property inside the div along the text value
